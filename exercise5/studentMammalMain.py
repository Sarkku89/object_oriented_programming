# Calling the main function

"""import diceClass5.Create a class called Student and use the following data attributes:
first name, last name and student id. Remember to code accessor 
and mutator methods and str-method. Store students and their pet mammal 
to dictionary (use the mammals from Exercise 4). Think, what should 
be used as the dictionary key. Code a function that prints out 
each student and their mammalâ€™s information. 
Use informative and clear output print.
6.Let the student select his/her pet mammal by rolling 2 dices 
and using their sum to indicate a correct mammal. The higher the number, 
the heavier mammal you get as your pet. (2 points)
